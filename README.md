### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare data

### Description
You will learn about bike share use in:
	Chicago
	New York City
	and Washington 
by computing a variety of descriptive statistics.

In this project, we will provide the following information :
#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
	most common month
	most common day of week
	most common hour of day
#2 Popular stations and trip
	most common start station
	most common end station
	most common trip from start to end 
#3 Trip duration
	total travel time
	average travel time
#4 User info
	counts of each user type
	counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
	earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

At the last section of this project, you will be able to see the first 5 lines of the data and so on.

### Software required
	You should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
	A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
	A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).

### Files used
In this project, i use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States. 
I will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington DC.

## The dataset
All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
	Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
	End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
	Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
	Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
	End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
	User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
	Gender
	Birth Year
